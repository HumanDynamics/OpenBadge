/** @file

 *
 * @brief Timer implementation to call timeout-handlers at specified intervals through a timer-thread.
 *
 * @details This module provides the functionality to create and start timer that expires at specific intervals.
 *			If a timer expires a timeout-handler is called.
 *			
 *
 * @note	This module is not based on RTOS, just on normal pthreads. So the main-context can still be executed, 
 *			although the timeout-handler is currently executed.
 *			Each timeout-handler is completely executed before another/next timeout-handler could be called.
