 * @details	The function is optimized for sequential writing. 
 *			It is optimized for handling STORAGE1_LAST_STORED_ELEMENT_ADDRESSES_SIZE different
 *			addresses for sequential storing. It only erases pages if it is necessary and restores the data 
 *			on the first erased page that are in front of the current data address.
 *			If the application needs more than STORAGE1_LAST_STORED_ELEMENT_ADDRESSES_SIZE different sequential 
 *			addresses, this value has to be increased.
 *			The function converts the bytes to words and store them in the flash.
 *			If the store operation fails (because of e.g. softdevice) the internal last_stored_element_addresses-array
 *			is set nevertheless, so if the application stores to the same address again, it will be erased.
 *
 * @warning When storing data, all data that have been stored before on the same page but behind the new data, will be deleted.
 *			Furthermore, the erasing of pages before storing data to them could lead to inconsistent data, if the power supply is interrupted.
 *			The application has to take care of this (by using checksums for real critical data).
 * 
 * @param[in]	address					The address of the first byte to write.
 * @param[in]	data					Pointer to the bytes to store.
 * @param[in]	length_data				The number of bytes.
 *
 * @retval 		NRF_SUCCSS					If operation was successful.
 * @retval 		NRF_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM		If data is NULL or specified address and length_data exceed the storage size.
 * @retval 		NRF_ERROR_BUSY				If the underlying storage-module (here flash) is busy.
 * @retval 		NRF_ERROR_INTERNAL			If the underlying storage-module (here flash) was not correctly initialized or if something went wrong during the calculation of the backup-data size.
 * @retval		NRF_ERROR_TIMEOUT			If the operation timed out (sth. went wrong while flash storing/erasing) or the operation takes too long.
