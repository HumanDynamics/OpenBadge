/**@file
 * @details This module provides a chunk-FIFO to store whole chunks with additional infos in a FIFO with a given size.
 *			One application of a chunk-FIFO is for example when different modules need to exchange data in a safe way.
 *			Safe means that while a chunk is not read by the application it couldn't be overwritten.
 *			In difference to other FIFO implementations with a put()- and a get()-function, this implementation
 *			provides two functions for opening and closing an operation like reading or writing.
 *			The open functions directly provide pointers that could be casted to any desired structure to work on.
 *			This has the benefit that no memcpy or sth like this has to be done. Important when used in ISRs.
