/**
 * Macro for creating a buffer appropriate for use with the ext_eeprom_write function.
 *   Buffer needs to have 4 extra bytes at start, for external EEPROM opcode+address
 * The following macro sets up a union that accomplishes this, while allowing the actual data
 *   to be manipulated (via the .data member) as a normal array without the 4-byte padding.
 * Example usage: 
 *   CREATE_TX_BUFFER(buffer,1);
 *   buffer.data[0] = 42;
 *   ext_eeprom_write(address,buffer.whole,sizeof(buffer.whole));
