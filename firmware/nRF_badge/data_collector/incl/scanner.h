/**
 * External AT25XE041B flash (or EEPROM)
 *
 * Similarly to the internal flash, the external EEPROM is organized into "chunks" for storing scan data
 *   One chunk is one scan result, containing the ID, average RSSI, and number of sightings for each device
 * In a large scan, this might require more than one chunk's worth of space.  Such chunks are specially
 *   marked, and the data is divided into however many chunks are required.
 * 
 * Chunk structure:
 * [ timestamp ][num ][ padding ][  ID1  ][rssi1][count][  ID1  ][rssi1][count]...[  ID29  ][rssi29][count][ timestamp ]
 *    32bits     8bit    24bit     16bit   8bit   8bit    16bit   8bit   8bit       16bit    8bit    8bit      32bit
 *            128bytes total
 *   Timestamp is the timestamp of the beginning of the chunk.  The end timestamp is used to
 *     mark complete chunks, similar to the internal flash chunks
 *   Type says what's in the chunk.  E.g. a complete scan result report, or the second half
 *     of a scan results.  Or a table of device addresses.
 *   Num is the number of devices seen in the entire scan.  (may be more than what's listed in
 *     a single chunk)
