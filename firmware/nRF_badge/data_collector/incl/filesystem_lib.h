 * @brief Filesystem optimized for different partitions of sequential store/read operations.
 *
 * @details The application can register partitions for storing and reading records/elements. 
 *			Each record in a partition contains a record/element-header followed by the actual data bytes.
 *			The element-header has a 2-Byte record-id that is incremented for each sequential record. 
 *			Optionally a 2-Byte CRC-value can be stored in the header to detect corrupted data.
 *			The element-header at the first address in each partition contains additional metadata about the partition.
 *			So the structure of a partition looks like this: (The number in the brackets represents the number of bytes needed.)
 *			| metadata (14) | element-header (2-6) | --- data --- | element-header (2-6) | --- data --- | element-header (2-6) | --- data --- | ...
 *
 * @details There are two different types of partitions: static and dynamic. 
 *			A static partition can be used for storing/reading a constant number of bytes for each entry/record.
 *			A dynamic partition can be used for storing/reading a variable number of bytes for each entry/record.
 *			The dynamic partition is organized as a XORed doubly linked list. Therefore another entry in the element-header
 *			is done to retrieve the address of the previous and next element/record.
 *
 * @details Because flash store operations can lead to inconsistent data if the power supply breaks down, 
 *			some safety countermeasurements are incorporated. A swap page for the first element-headers for each partition
 *			is implemented to backup the first element-header to prevent data loss. The swap-page is placed at the beginning 
 *			of the storage. It is advantageous to have the swap-page in a storage with byte-units like EEPROM.
 *
 * @details	For reading the sequential records/elements of a partition, an iterator should be used. 
 *			It could happen that the element the iterator is currently pointing to is overwritten by new data.
 *			In this case the iterator is invalidated, and the application needs to reinitialize the iterator.

/** @brief Function for storing an element (some bytes) to a partition.
 *
 * @details	The function computes the address where to store the next element and stores the element-data together with an element-header.
 *			Each time an element-header is stored, the function checks the correctness of the store operation by reading and compring the element-header.
 *
 *			If the element is stored to the first address in the partition, the procedure is the following:
 *			Before the first-element-header in storage is overwritten by the new first-element-header, the new first-element-header is backuped in the swap-page.
 *			This is done, because if the store operation fails (because of a breaked power supply), we would loose the reference to the last element (in a dynamic partition),
 *			and we wouldn't find it anymore if the whole first unit (in case of flash) is erased/corrupted.
 *			Furthermore, if there are repeated store operations in the first unit, 
 *			this backup is needed to keep a valid partition even if the first-element-header is corrupted during these store-operations.
 *			
 * @note 	It is advantageous to keep the swap-page in a storage part with a unit size of one byte, because if different partitions alternately store in their first unit,
 *			the first-element-header must be backupt each time. If the addresses of the backupt first-element-headers are on the same unit (e.g. in flash), 
 *			it could happen that they delete each other backupt first-element-header. In this case the first-element-header has to be rewritten more often, 
 *			in worst case "#partitions x #store operations on first unit" times.
