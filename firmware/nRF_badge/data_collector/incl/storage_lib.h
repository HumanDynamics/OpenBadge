 *			the other modules should be able to handle multiple init-calls.

 * @retval 		NRF_ERROR_INTERNAL			If the underlying storage-module could not correctly initialized.
 * @retval 		NRF_ERROR_BUSY				If the operation could not be performed currently, because the underlying storage module is busy or it depends on another module that is busy.
 * @retval		NRF_ERROR_TIMEOUT			If the operation takes too long.
